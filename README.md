# Cinema

This was a project that I set out to do after finishing an Angular course.

Cinema is a web application where different movies are shown according to the category you select. Clicking on the image of the movie, it will take you to another path where you can see information about the selected movie, for example: year of release, genres to which it belongs, duration, actors and more.

You will receive recommendations according to the movie you have selected.

You can also enter the profile of an actor who has participated in the film, to see their information, the application will recommend movies where the actor has appeared.

The application uses Angular Router, with query params for pagination, which will keep the page you are on, even if you refresh and you can also navigate through the url.

All design was created by me, from scratch, using only `CSS` with the `BEM methodology` and putting `Mobile First` into practice, which adapted to any screen size.

The information comes from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)'s API.

It was a fun project to do and I am very satisfied with the result.
